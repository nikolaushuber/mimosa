# Mimosa Language Documentation

Mimosa is a new programming language specifically targetting embedded (control) applications. It builds upon the [MIMOS model](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-08143-9_2) of computation, therefore it describes a program as a collection of computational components (called *nodes*), which communicate through FIFO buffers (called *channels*).

This documentations explains the syntax of the language, and shows how a MIMOS program can be simulated.
