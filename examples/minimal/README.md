# Minimal example

This example is the same as the one shown in the [Mimosa documentation](https://nikolaushuber.github.io/mimosa/simple_example/).

## Simulation harness

The **print** node is implemented to print to stdout.

## Running the example

The example can be run in the following way:

```bash
dune exec -- minimal_sim.exe 400
```

The argument `400` is the amount of milliseconds that shall be simulated.
